# License-Plate-Recognition
This repo contains two License Plate Recognition files, both of which are realized in Matlab.

Note:
This file used to be the project for matrix theory course in undergraduate study. As a result, the name of the file is MatrixTheory. Plus, I attach a PDF file to the code. This file was the report for the course. I hope it can help you better understand what I am doing.

Learning License Plate Recognition is an efficient way to obtain much knowledge about Digital Image Processing. Here we go!
